This code is designed to add the rows navigatation to the jQuery DataTable plugin.
This is an alpha, I built it at work but at the moment the task is suspended. To be continued...

Just open index.html inside your favourite browser and see it in action: key arrows keys should move the selection up and down the rows.
The plugin doesn't seem to work with paginated dataTables yet.
