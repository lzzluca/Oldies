A fork from:
jQuery DataTables jPaginator plugin v1.0
by Ernani Azevedo <azevedo@intellinews.com.br>

The fork was born from this topic:

Licensed under GPL v3.0.

You'll need jQuery DataTables (http://datatables.net/) and jPaginator
(http://remylab.github.com/jpaginator/) loaded before load this one.

An updated version on this code is available, look here:
