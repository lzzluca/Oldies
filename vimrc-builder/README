I am going to introduce here the .vimrc builder (also inspired by
David Escribano Garcia https://github.com/DavidEGx ): the .vimrc grows
quickly so I was looking for a way to keep it modular and organized.
It is basically a Makefile: it concats the vimrcp files (vimrcp as vimrc part)
in the root folder three, adding also basic comments for the different sections.
This is the three explanation:
root:
  |__-_Makefile       : the builder
  |__-_generic.vimrcp : generic settings, (for example, I have there the
                          function to avoid the "replace mode")
  |__-_sets.vimrcp    : all the sets! 
  |__-_wcn.vimrcp     : these are settings for my company, WCN plc . Every file
                        added to the root is builded, if its extension is
                          .vimrcp
  |__d_keymaps        : inside here are expected to be all the keymap vimrcp
                          files (related to vim and not to plugins, for example
                          keymaps to move around tabs)
  |__d_plugins        : inside here are expected to be all the vimrcp files
                          related to plugins
    |__d_dependencies : plugins dependencies, (like Vundle header and footer)
    |__d_keymaps      : well, the same of the "keymaps" folder above, but this
                          one targets the plugins

The builder expects the files generic.vimrcp and sets.vimrcp, plus the folders
"keymaps" and "plugins". All the file added in root (in my repo, for example,
wcn.vimrcp) are included in the building too. Files inside the folder "old",
instead, are ignored.
NOTE: only file with .vimrc extension will be builded! Change the extension
makes the file ingored.

To get my .vimrc with all the plugins, just run make to get the .vimrc builded;
copy the generated .vimrc in your home (make a backup copy of your previous!).
Then install Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
(close and) open vim and run:
:BundleInstall
All the plugins should be installed!
